                        Global CO2 emissions have been growing over the past 70 years, and despite existing policies and climate agreements in place,
                        certain regions and/or countries are still significant contributors. This is likely due to the pursue of economic growth and 
                        rapid industralization.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Identifying the world's largest contributors can enable more targeted policies, and a better understanding of the roles of these 
                        powerful nations in shaping the emissions landscape.

                                    The order of categories here however, seem to be determined by the absolute value of CO2 emissions in the year 2022, as seen by
                                    how China and Asia are the bottom two categories even though the US and the European Union have larger cumulative CO2 emissions.

                                    <u> Starting origin:</u> Instead of starting the graph from the x-axis, the "origin" is located somewhere in the middle, in a bid to mimic the stacked
                                    area graph as emissions from an emissions tower, to increase aesthetic appeal. However, this could contribute to <strong> mis-interpretation of the trends</strong>,
                                    especially if one misunderstands the function of a stacked area chart, which in this case is to show the major contributors of global CO2 emissions.

                                    <u> Additional x-axis:</u> With <strong> too many categories</strong>, there is likely a need for <strong> an additional x-axis</strong>
